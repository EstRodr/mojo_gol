# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is Conway's Game of Life?
Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It's a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

### Why use Mojo for this implementation?
Mojo combines the performance of low-level languages with the ease of use of Python. This implementation showcases Mojo's capabilities for numerical computing and performance optimization.

## Installation

### What are the system requirements?
- A computer with a modern CPU
- At least 100MB of free disk space
- Python 3.8 or later
- Mojo SDK installed
- Pygame for visualization (optional)

### How do I install the Mojo SDK?
Follow the official installation guide at [Modular's documentation](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/).

## Usage

### How do I run the simulation?
```bash
# Run directly with the Mojo interpreter
mojo life/life.mojo

# Or build and run as an executable (optional)
mojo build life/life.mojo -o life/game_of_life
./life/game_of_life
```

### How do I change the grid size?
Use the `--rows` and `--cols` arguments:
```bash
mojo life/life.mojo --rows 50 --cols 80
```

### How do I change the speed of the simulation?
Use the `--fps` argument to set frames per second:
```bash
mojo life/life.mojo --fps 30
```

## Customization

### How do I create custom patterns?
You can create custom patterns by modifying the `initialize_custom` function in `life.mojo` or by using the interactive mode to draw patterns.

### Can I change the colors?
Yes, use the `--alive-color` and `--dead-color` arguments:
```bash
mojo life/life.mojo --alive-color "#FF0000" --dead-color "#000000"
```

## Performance

### The simulation is slow with large grids. How can I improve performance?
Try these optimizations:
1. Reduce the frame rate with `--fps`
2. Disable grid lines with `--grid-color none`
3. Use a smaller grid size
4. Compile with optimizations: `mojo build -O3 life/life.mojo -o life/game_of_life`

### How much memory does the simulation use?
Memory usage is approximately `rows * cols * 8` bytes. For example, a 1000x1000 grid uses about 8MB of memory.

## Development

### How do I contribute to this project?
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your changes
3. Make your changes and test them
4. Submit a pull request

### How do I run the tests?
```bash
mojo test life/tests/
```

## Troubleshooting

### I'm getting an error about Pygame. What should I do?
Install Pygame using pip:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

### The simulation window doesn't appear. What's wrong?
Check that:
1. You have a graphical environment running (X11/Wayland on Linux, etc.)
2. Pygame is installed correctly
3. No error messages are being shown in the terminal

### The simulation crashes with large grids. Why?
This is likely due to memory limitations. Try reducing the grid size or running on a machine with more memory.

## Advanced

### Can I use this on a headless server?
Yes, but you'll need to set up a virtual display or use the `--no-gui` flag if implemented.

### How can I save the current state of the simulation?
This feature is not yet implemented, but you can modify the code to save the grid state to a file.

### Can I extend this to 3D?
Yes, but it would require significant changes to the codebase. The current implementation is 2D only.

## License and Attribution

### Can I use this code in my own project?
Yes, this project is licensed under the MIT License. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

### How should I attribute this project?
Please include a link to the original repository and mention the original authors.

## Common Error Messages

### "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pygame'"
Install Pygame:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

### "Error: Mojo compiler not found"
Make sure the Mojo SDK is installed and added to your PATH.

### "Grid index out of bounds"
You're trying to access a cell outside the grid boundaries. Check your indices.

## Performance Tips

1. **Use smaller grids** for better performance
2. **Lower the frame rate** for large simulations
3. **Disable visualization** for pure computation
4. **Compile with optimizations**: `mojo build -O3`

## Known Issues

- [ ] Memory usage could be optimized for very large grids
- [ ] Some patterns may not work correctly at grid boundaries
- [ ] Window resizing is not fully implemented
